# PSoC 6 MCU: CM4 SPI Video Stream Decoder to VGA

This CM4 project provides means to update the shared VGA memory 
buffers in order to display a live, low latency video feed on
a VGA monitor. 

This project requires an external ESP32 module that takes an 
incoming video feed generated by the transmitter and relays the feed 
over SPI for the PSoC to process. 

The CM4 core is in charge of scheduling SPI transfers, realizing
when a frame has been fully received, decoding the frame, and
outputting it to the shared VGA framebuffer. 

Frames are heavily compressed, huffman coded discrete cosine transform
encoded, YCbCr images. So this core: 

- Checks if ESP32 says frame data is available and we're in a vertical blanking interval 
- Initiates an SPI transfers as a master until it buffered an entire sequence that describes a frame. 
- Huffman decodes and IDCTs the Y, Cr, and Cb channels of the sequence. 
- Color converts the YCbCr to RGB and writes the data to the VGA framebuffer appropriately
